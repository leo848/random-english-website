  I lived in Melbourne for half a year and was very surprised about the hot temperatures, wild animals
  and school subjects like Cooking. I had the opportunity to go surfing and snorkelling.
  The other students were very open and helpful and loved learning about life in Germany. Going to school abroad 
  was very relaxing because teachers weren't as strict. It was lots of fun doing outer school activities like swimming
  and sport days.
